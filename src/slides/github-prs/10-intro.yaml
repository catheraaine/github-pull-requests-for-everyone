      * Maybe Bitbucket or GitLab is more your thing? It all works.
      * The first time I gave this talk it was in a 45 minute slot. It took me about 36 minutes. I gave it again in a one hour slot at conference called CodeMash last year. I added a few slides to make up for the time, so of course, it only took 32 minutes. Another time I gave it, I needed to fit everything into a 30 minute slot. I cut out the stuff I added and told my self to talk quickly. So, of course, it only took me 17 minutes.

      Today I'm going for at least 45 minutes, and I've added a bunch of content, so I'll probably be done in about 8.5 minutes.

      * I'm Catherine, I'm a full-stack developer (whatever that means).
      * I work at Sparkbox, a web design and development consultant in Dayton, Ohio.
      * That's me on Twitter
      * I use she/her pronouns.
      * I spent most of my last couple years building a single enterprise-level design system that supports a number of ecommerce sites built in a multitude of JavaScript frameworks, the largest of which is React.
      * One thing never changes, though. That's git.

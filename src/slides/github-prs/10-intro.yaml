      The first time I gave this talk it was in a 45 minute slot. It took me about 36 minutes. I gave it again in a one hour slot at conference called CodeMash in January. I added a few slides to make up for the time, so of course, it only took 32 minutes. The last time I gave it, I needed to fit everything into a 30 minute slot. I cut out the stuff I added and told my self to talk quickly. So, of course, it only took me 17 minutes.

      Today I'm going for at least 30 minutes, and I've added a bunch of content, so I'll probably be done in about 8.5 minutes.

      - I'm Catherine, I'm a full-stack developer (whatever that means).
      - I use she/her pronouns.
      - I work at a small webshop in Ohio, Sparkbox.
      - I spent most of my last couple years building a single enterprise-level design system.
      - The past few weeks I've been doing more JavaScript-based work, along with some Docker chores and accessibility improvements.
      - One thing never changes, though. That's git.

      * Skitch is a free app from Evernote, and probably my favorite thing on these slides. I use it _daily_.
      * Skitch is loved by Sparkbox for everything from full page decomps to quick design edits to making memes of coworkers.

    notes: |
      * Skitch provides elegant markup tools for drawing boxes, adding arrows, and highlighting necessary changes.
      * Take a screenshot (shift + command + 4 on macOS) and have at it.

      * Skitch works well in the opposite direction of RecordIt. It’s an easy way for designers to communicate desired changes with developers—make this bigger, reduce this space, delete this link, etc.
      * Skitch provides visual feedback for visual thinkers.

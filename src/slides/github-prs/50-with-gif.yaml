      ![Coding Kitty Gif](images/cat-codes.gif) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100%" -->
    notes: |
      * This is one of my favorites, because it is a Cat. Coding. It's me.
      * But what if a gif can be more than a quick laugh?
      * Gifs are awesome for showing nav functionality, transitions, hover effects, animations, and pretty much any visual aspect of your work.
      * Gifs are especially useful for getting a design review of an animation or hover from someone who may not have the site running locally.

      ### Recordit
      ##### [recordit.co](http://recordit.co/)

    notes: |
      * RecordIt is a screencasting service that lets you save your finished recording as a .gif and even gives you the hosted link.

    notes: |
      * An example is the Foundry, the Sparkbox blog: the CMS that the Foundry is built on is a big deal to set up, especially for a designer or project manager trying to review one or two lines of code or content.
      * By including a gif, you can give the necessary context and allow everyone to feel confident in what they are approving.

      ### Recordit
      ##### [recordit.co](http://recordit.co/)

    notes: |
      * One downside to RecordIt is that it doesn’t currently support `https`, which means, as you may know, it cannot be embedded directly into a PR on GitHub, however, it can still work in Slack or via a link.

      ### Gifox
      ##### [gifox.io](https://gifox.io/)

    notes: |
      * As an alternative, I've recently discovered Gifox.
      * This is a native app that creates gifs you can host via GitHub just like an image.
      * Hosting on GitHub gives you the full privacy of your repo, so you're hopefully not violating any security policies!
      * It does cost $5, or included if you have Setapp, and only works on MacOS (?)
      * There are lots of gifing tools out there, it is the thought that counts.

      ![Coding Kitty Gif](images/cat-codes.gif) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100%" -->
    notes: |
      * This is one of my favorites, because it is a Cat. Coding. It's me.
      * But what if a gif can be more than a quick laugh?
      * Gifs are awesome for showing nav functionality, transitions, hover effects, animations, and pretty much any visual aspect of your work.
      * Gifs are especially useful for getting a design review of an animation or hover from someone who may not have the site running locally.

    notes: |
      * An example is the Foundry, the Sparkbox blog: the CMS that the Foundry is built on is a big deal to set up, especially for a designer or project manager trying to review one or two lines of code or content.
      * By including a gif, you can give the necessary context and allow everyone to feel confident in what they are approving.

      ### Recordit
      ##### [recordit.co](http://recordit.co/)

    notes: |
      * One downside to RecordIt is that it doesnâ€™t currently support `https`, which means, as you may know, it cannot be embedded directly into a PR on GitHub, however, it can still work in Slack or via a link.

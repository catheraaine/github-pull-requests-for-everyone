      ## "The Big Three of Git Storage: Comparing GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket"
      ##### [http://bit.ly/meade-git-storage](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/github_vs_gitlab_vs_bitbucket)

    notes: |
      * I also have an article about the big three in git storage. 
      * I wrote this article with many months of dedicated research, talked to every developer I knew, and tried working with all the options.
      * So of course Microsoft bought Github as soon as I finished.

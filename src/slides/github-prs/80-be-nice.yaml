      # Give Valuable Feedback: Be Nice

    notes: |
      * One last way to make your PRs friendlier is to, well, be friendly.
      * A spat via GitHub comments is no way to collaborate, and let‚Äôs face it, we know communication via text doesn‚Äôt always communicate tone (a good reason to use emoji üòÅ ).

      ###### Bryan Braun, Sparkbox Developer
      ## "Stop Giving Depressing Code Reviews"
      ##### tiny.cc/foundry-braun

    notes: |
      * A coworker of mine, Bryan, whom you know, wrote an article about this topic.
      * The idea is to give as much positive code feedback as you do correction.

      <blockquote>‚ÄúGiving positive feedback is an easy habit to adopt. You're already reading through the lines of code, looking for issues. It doesn't take much time to throw in a ‚ÄòNice!‚Äô or ‚ÄòLooks great!‚Äô If you see something awesome, say it!‚Äù<br /> - Bryan Braun</blockquote>

      * This is really difficult for me. My Meyers-Briggs type is a INTJ. Famous INTJs are such lovable characters, like Minecroft from Sherlock, Walter White from Breaking Bad, and Littlefinger from Game of Thrones. We're not nice by default. We can be a little direct.
      * Sometimes positive feedback feels fake, but that's okay. It won't read that way.
      * I really like leading zeros on decimal points in CSS. In any language, I enjoy descriptive comments. I am always complimenting these things, and it may feel forced, but it is honest.
      * A few positive comments make a huge difference in overall tone of a review, whether you are speaking with developers, designers, or other team contributors.

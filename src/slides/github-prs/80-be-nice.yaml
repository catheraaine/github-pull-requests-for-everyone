      # Give Valuable Feedback: Be Nice

    notes: |
      * One last way to make your PRs friendlier is to, well, be friendly.
      * A spat via GitHub comments is no way to collaborate, and let‚Äôs face it, we know communication via text doesn‚Äôt always communicate tone (a good reason to use emoji üòÅ ).

      ###### Bryan Braun, Sparkbox Developer, Eagle Scout <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## "Stop Giving Depressing Code Reviews"
      ##### [tiny.cc/foundry-braun](tiny.cc/foundry-braun)

    notes: |
      * A coworker of mine, Bryan, wrote an article about this topic.
      * The idea is to give as much positive code feedback as you do correction.

      * This is really difficult for me. My Meyers-Briggs type is a INTJ. Famous INTJs are such lovable characters, like Minecroft from Sherlock, Walter White from Breaking Bad, and Littlefinger from Game of Thrones. We're not nice by default. We can be a little, eh, direct.
      * Sometimes positive feedback feels fake, but that's okay. It won't read that way.
      * I really like leading zeros on decimal points in CSS. In any language, I enjoy descriptive comments. I am always complimenting these things when I see them. 
      * It may feel forced, but it is honest.

      ## Be Nice.

    notes: |
      * This is my last feedback for you all, but it is the single most important thing I've shared today.
      * A few positive comments make a huge difference in overall tone of a review, whether you are speaking with developers, designers, or other team contributors.
      * Hopefully at least one of these tools can make the PR experience more accessible for your whole team‚Äînot just the developers.
      * With a healthy dose of empathy, we can improve the way our coworkers review the code we write, and as a result, we can create smoother workflows, increase both speed and communication, and make better websites.

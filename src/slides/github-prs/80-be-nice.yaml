      # Give Valuable Feedback: Be Nice
    notes: |
      * One last way to make your PRs friendlier is to, well, be friendly.
      * A spat via GitHub comments is no way to collaborate, and let’s face it, we know communication via text doesn’t always communicate tone (a good reason to use emoji 😁 ).

      ###### Bryan Braun, Sparkbox Developer, Eagle Scout <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## "Stop Giving Depressing Code Reviews"
      ##### http://tiny.cc/foundry-braun

    notes: |
      * A coworker of mine, Bryan, wrote an article about this topic.
      * The idea is to give as much positive code feedback as you do correction.

      <blockquote>“Giving positive feedback is an easy habit to adopt. You're already reading through the lines of code, looking for issues. It doesn't take much time to throw in a ‘Nice!’ or ‘Looks great!’ If you see something awesome, say it!”<br /> - Bryan Braun</blockquote>

      * A few positive comments make a huge difference in overall tone of a review, whether you are speaking with developers, designers, or other team contributors.

      # How Sparkbox Does Code Reviews
    notes: |
      * Today, I am going to share with you a few tools and techniques to make your pull requests more effective and collaborative.
      * I hope to do a quick summary of a few tools and I hope you will look into them further after the event.
      * Most of these tools are not GitHub exclusive, so I hope at least one of them will be useful to each one of you.
      * To start, I should explain a bit about how Sparkbox, the shop I work at, does code reviews.

    notes: |
      * At Sparkbox, we store nearly all of our code on GitHub, in shared repositories dedicated to whatever engagement on which we are currently working.
      * When developers have new code to add to the project, they ask other developers for a code review via a pull request. Sometimes that's called a "merge request".
      * I've come up with six sort of "Rules" that Sparkboxers adhear to while using Git Cloud Storage.

      ###### Rule One <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## No one merges their own code.
    notes: |
      * Rule One: No one merges their own code.
      * Sparkbox likes to avoid the concept of a ‚Äúdeveloper island‚Äù where one developer is writing and merging all code for a piece of a website.
      * A few years ago, we had a client want an additional full-time developer for a side project, where the dev would be working alone. We offered two developers at half time, having a reviewer is that important.

      ###### Rule Two <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## Never push directly to master.
    notes: |
      * Rule Two: Never push directly to master.
      * Pushing directly to master is the easiest way to break everything.
      * Requiring a code review reinforces the quality code we've come to value.

      ###### Rule Three <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## If you are working with UI, get a design review. üé®
    notes: |
      * Rule Three: If you are working with UI, get a design review.
      * At Sparkbox, we have a ‚ÄúFrontend Designer‚Äù on every project we design. This special designer often writes frontend code.
      * But not every company has designers who know how to code, nor should they (that's a talk for another day).
      * Having a designer do a visual check of your site saves time correcting things after merge.

      ###### Rule Four <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## If you‚Äôre working on copy, get a copy review. üìì
    notes: |
      * Similarly, If you are working on copy, get a copy review.
      * At Sparkbox, this often comes from the Project Manager, or perhaps a client.

      ###### Rule Five <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## Never, ever push directly to master. üò¨
    notes: |
      * Rule Five: Never, ever push directly to master.
      * Okay, unless you messed up. But if you did, find a buddy to pair with.
      * which leads me to:

      ###### Rule Six <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
      ## Rules are more like‚Ä¶ guidelines. üòâ
      #### github.com/sparkbox/standard <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    notes: |
      * All these rules are more like‚Ä¶ guidelines.
      * This ensures we follow the basic Sparkbox Creed: Working together for a better web.
      * If every piece of code has at least two people contributing it, then we often catch mistakes before they happen.
      * If you are interested in more about this kind of thing at Sparkbox specifically, it is documented in our Standard.

      ## Challenges of Collaboration
    notes: |
      * Collaboration is hard, and comes with all kinds of challenges, such as
      * Getting a PR Review from a non-coder.
      * Getting a PR Review from someone in a different time zone.
      * Working with developers who may _only_ be doing reviews on your project.
      * How do we improve collaboration on our projects?
      * Well, that's why we're here.

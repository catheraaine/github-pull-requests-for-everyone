      # Write Good Stories

    notes: |
      * To ensure good pull requests, try to write good issues.
      * At Sparkbox, we often use ZenHub, GitHub Projects, Jira, or Trello to organize engagements, usually with something like Scrum. But not "real" Scrum. Scrum-adjacent. Ask Drew if you have questions about that.
      * Our workflow usually involves creating "stories" representing bite-sized chunks of work.

      ![Good Story Example](images/good-story.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->

    notes: |
      * A story should include the requirements of the work and a potential solution (if you have one in mind).
      * A story or issue doesnâ€™t need to be overly complicated, but should be easy to understand.
      * A well-written story makes for clear requirements when it comes time to PR.
      * This leads you to my first tool recomendation, and the only one that BitBucket doesn't yet have.

      ### Github Issue Templates
      ##### [tiny.cc/github-issue-templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
      ###### via GitHub

    notes: |
      * Issue Templates (and PR Templates) allow you to add a markdown file to your root directory to outline the issue process.

    notes: |
      * Here is my template, written in markdown, and included in my project.

      ![Issue template highlighted in the file tree](images/issue-temp-tree.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->

    notes: |
      * In addition to adding the template file to the root of your project, you can include it via you `.github` directory.
      * PR Templates are also a thing that can go in this directory. They work the same but have a different filename.

    content: |
      ![Issue template live on GitHub](images/issue-temp-live.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->

    notes: |
      * When I go to make a new issue on GitHub, the text field prepopulates with the contents of the template file.
      * These example files are stored in the repo I linked at the begining, and I'll share the link again at the end.

      ### Github Issue Templates
      ##### [tiny.cc/github-issue-templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
      ###### via GitHub

    notes: |
      * While BitBucket does not directly support templates, it is still possible to have a template or a set of parameters to work from.
      * Talk with your project team to decide what should go into this template, mine is just an example.

      ###### Kasey Bonifacio, Sparkbox Developer
      ## "Writing Better Release Notes"
      ##### tiny.cc/foundry-bonifacio

    notes: |
      * A coworker of mine, Kasey, whom you know, wrote an article somewhat recently about writing release notes as your stories are closed.
      * We've begun integrating this into a number of projects, a few of them within the templates themselves.
      * There are also example PR and Issue templates in the Sparkbox Standard I linked earlier.

      # Write Good Stories
    note: |
      * To ensure good pull requests, try to write good issues.
      * At Sparkbox, we often use ZenHub or GitHub Projects to organize engagements, usually with something like Scrum.
      * This involves creating “stories” (with GitHub issues), representing bite-sized chunks of work.

    notes: |
      * A story should include the requirements of the work and a potential solution (if you have one in mind).
      * A story/issue doesn’t need to be overly complicated, but should be easy to understand.
      * A well-written story makes for clear requirements when it comes time to PR.

      ### Github Issue Templates
      ##### [tiny.cc/github-issue-templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
      ###### via GitHub

    notes: |
      * Issue Templates (and PR Templates) allow you to add a markdown file to your root directory to outline the issue process.

    notes: |
      * Here is my template, written in markdown, and included in my project.

      ![Issue template highlighted in the file tree](images/issue-temp-tree.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->

    notes: |
      * In addition to adding the template file to the root of your project, you can include it via you `.github` directory.
      * PR Templates are also a thing that can go in this directory. They work the same but have a different filename.

      ![Issue template live on GitHub](images/issue-temp-live.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->

    notes: |
      * When I go to make a new issue on GitHub, the text field prepopulates with the contents of the template file.
      * These example files are stored in the repo I linked at the begining, and I'll share the link again at the end.

    notes: |
      * Talk with your project team to decide what should go into this template, mine is just an example. A checklist is nice!

      # How Sparkbox Does Code Reviews
Notes:* So today I am going to share with you a few tools and techniques to make your pull requests more effective and collaborative. Because of time, I hope to do a quick summary of a few tools and I hope you will look into them further after the event.
* ~To help with that, my slides are available online, at~
* To start, I should explain a bit about how we at Sparkbox do code reviews.

      ![Female code octocat by Github](images/octo-cat.png)
Notes:* Here at Sparkbox, we store nearly all of our code on GitHub, in shared repositories dedicated to whatever engagement on which we are currently working.
* When developers have new code to add to the project, they ask other developers for a code review via a pull request.

    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule One <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## No one merges their own code.
Notes:* We avoid the concept of a ‚Äúdeveloper island‚Äù where one developer is writing and merging all code for a piece of a website.
* Last year we had a client want an additional full-time developer for a side project. We offered two developers at half time, having a reviewer is that important.

      ###### Rule Two <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Never push directly to master.
Notes:* Pushing directly to master is the easiest way to break everything.
* Requiring a code review reinforces the quality we&#x27;ve come to value.

      ###### Rule Three <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## If you are working with UI, get a design review. üé®
Notes:* At Sparkbox, we have a ‚ÄúFrontend Designer‚Äù on every project we design, but not every designer knows how to code.

      ###### Rule Four <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->

      ###### Rule Six <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Rules are more like... guidelines. üòâ
Notes:* This ensures we follow the basic Sparkbox Creed: Working together for a Web Built Right.

* But what if a gif can be more than a quick laugh?
* Gifs are awesome for showing nav functionality, transitions, hover effects, animations, and pretty much any visual aspect of your work.
* Gifs are especially useful for getting a design review of an animation or hover from someone who may not have the site running locally.

##### [recordit.co](http://recordit.co/)
Notes:* RecordIt is a screencasting service that lets you save your finished recording as a .gif and even gives you the hosted link.

Notes:* An example is the Foundry, the Sparkbox blog: the CMS that the Foundry is built on is a big deal to set up, especially for a designer or project manager trying to review one or two lines of code or content.
* By including a gif, you can give the necessary context and allow everyone to feel confident in what they are approving.

##### [recordit.co](http://recordit.co/)
Notes:* One downside to RecordIt is that it doesn‚Äôt currently support &#x60;https&#x60;, which means, as you may know, it cannot be embedded directly into a PR on GitHub, however, it can still work in Slack or via a link.

      # Enhance Your Pull Request: with Video
Notes:* An important aspect of a complicated PR is the ability to walk someone through your code.
* In the current age, devs are often distributed or remote; we work in different timezones and have busy schedules.
* Sometimes it is nearly impossible to schedule 30 minutes to step through some code.

### GoVideo by Vidyard
##### [vidyard.com/govideo/](https://www.vidyard.com/govideo/)
Notes:* GoVideo is a Chrome Extension that lets a user record their screen, face, and voice all at once.
* Specifically, we used videos on an engagement where the main reviewer, me, was not dedicated to the project full-time.
* Because I was not available for standups, did not have a direct hand in building the site, and wasn‚Äôt familiar with the changes being reviewed, the dev needed to explain the changes clearly for every PR.
* GoVideo is one of my new favorite ways to start a code review, I‚Äôve made you a video to prove just how helpful it can be.

### GoVideo by Vidyard
##### [vidyard.com/govideo/](https://www.vidyard.com/govideo/)
Notes:* Depending on the size of the PR, a walk-through video only adds 5-10 minutes total to our setup time, but can potentially save the 30-60 minutes it might take to explain your PR via Slack or email (or scheduling a Zoom meeting).
* Useful when pairing with developers who have different schedules, who are remote, or who are not as familiar with the engagement.

##### [evernote.com/products/skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch)

### Skitch by Evernote
##### [evernote.com/products/skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch)
Notes:* Skitch works well in the opposite direction of RecordIt. It‚Äôs an easy way for designers to communicate desired changes with developers‚Äîmake this bigger, reduce this space, delete this link, etc.

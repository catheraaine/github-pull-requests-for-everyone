Notes:* Maybe Bitbucket or GitLab is more your thing? It all works.
* The first time I gave this talk it was in a 45 minute slot. It took me about 36 minutes. I gave it again in a one hour slot at conference called CodeMash last year. I added a few slides to make up for the time, so of course, it only took 32 minutes. Another time I gave it, I needed to fit everything into a 30 minute slot. I cut out the stuff I added and told my self to talk quickly. So, of course, it only took me 17 minutes.

      # How Sparkbox Does Code Reviews
Notes:* Today, I am going to share with you a few tools and techniques to make your pull requests more effective and collaborative.
* I hope to do a quick summary of a few tools and I hope you will look into them further after the event.
* Most of these tools are not GitHub exclusive, so I hope at least one of them will be useful to each one of you.
* To start, I should explain a bit about how Sparkbox, the shop I work at, does code reviews.

    <script type="text/template">
      ![Female code octocat by Github](images/octo-cat.png)  <!-- .element: style="height: 95vh" -->
Notes:* At Sparkbox, we store nearly all of our code on GitHub, in shared repositories dedicated to whatever engagement on which we are currently working.
* When developers have new code to add to the project, they ask other developers for a code review via a pull request. Sometimes that&#x27;s called a &quot;merge request&quot;.
* I&#x27;ve come up with six sort of &quot;Rules&quot; that Sparkboxers adhear to while using Git Cloud Storage.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule One <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## No one merges their own code.
Notes:* Rule One: No one merges their own code.
* Sparkbox likes to avoid the concept of a ‚Äúdeveloper island‚Äù where one developer is writing and merging all code for a piece of a website.
* A few years ago, we had a client want an additional full-time developer for a side project, where the dev would be working alone. We offered two developers at half time, having a reviewer is that important.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule Two <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Never push directly to master.
Notes:* Rule Two: Never push directly to master.
* Pushing directly to master is the easiest way to break everything.
* Requiring a code review reinforces the quality code we&#x27;ve come to value.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule Three <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## If you are working with UI, get a design review. üé®
Notes:* Rule Three: If you are working with UI, get a design review.
* At Sparkbox, we have a ‚ÄúFrontend Designer‚Äù on every project we design. This special designer often writes frontend code.
* But not every company has designers who know how to code, nor should they (that&#x27;s a talk for another day).
* Having a designer do a visual check of your site saves time correcting things after merge.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule Four <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## If you‚Äôre working on copy, get a copy review. üìì
Notes:* Similarly, If you are working on copy, get a copy review.
* At Sparkbox, this often comes from the Project Manager, or perhaps a client.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule Five <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Never, ever push directly to master. üò¨
Notes:* Rule Five: Never, ever push directly to master.
* Okay, unless you messed up. But if you did, find a buddy to pair with.
* which leads me to:

      ###### Rule Six <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Rules are more like‚Ä¶ guidelines. üòâ
#### github.com/sparkbox/standard <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Notes:* All these rules are more like‚Ä¶ guidelines.
* This ensures we follow the basic Sparkbox Creed: Working together for a better web.
* If every piece of code has at least two people contributing it, then we often catch mistakes before they happen.
* If you are interested in more about this kind of thing at Sparkbox specifically, it is documented in our Standard.

  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Challenges of Collaboration
Notes:* Collaboration is hard, and comes with all kinds of challenges, such as
* Getting a PR Review from a non-coder.
* Getting a PR Review from someone in a different time zone.
* Working with developers who may _only_ be doing reviews on your project.
* How do we improve collaboration on our projects?
* Well, that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re here.

      # Write Good Stories
Notes:* To ensure good pull requests, try to write good issues.
* At Sparkbox, we often use ZenHub, GitHub Projects, Jira, or Trello to organize engagements, usually with something like Scrum. But not &quot;real&quot; Scrum. Scrum-adjacent. Sparkbox Scrum. We adapt as needed.
* Our workflow usually involves creating &quot;stories&quot; representing bite-sized chunks of work.

      ![Good Story Example](images/good-story.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->
Notes:* A story should include the requirements of the work and a potential solution (if you have one in mind).
* A story or issue doesn‚Äôt need to be overly complicated, but should be easy to understand.
* A well-written story makes for clear requirements when it comes time to PR.

### Github Issue Templates
##### [tiny.cc/github-issue-templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
###### via GitHub
Notes:* Issue Templates (and PR Templates) allow you to add a markdown file to your root directory.
* These templates create an outline for well-written stories and pull requests.

    <script type="text/template">
      ![Issue template highlighted in the file tree](images/issue-temp-tree.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->
Notes:* In addition to adding the template file to the root of your project, you can include it via yours &#x60;.github&#x60; directory.
* PR Templates are also a thing that can go in this directory. They work the same but have a different filename.

### Github Issue Templates
##### [tiny.cc/github-issue-templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
###### via GitHub
Notes:* These examples are for GitHub, but last year, GitLab released a similar feature. 
* While BitBucket does not directly support templates, it is still possible to have a template or a set of parameters to work from.
* Talk with your project team to decide what should go into this template, mine is just an example.

## "Writing Better Release Notes"
##### tiny.cc/foundry-bonifacio
Notes:* A coworker of mine, Kasey, wrote an article about adding release notes as your stories are completed.
* We&#x27;ve begun integrating this into a number of projects, a few of them within the PR templates themselves.
* There are also example PR and Issue templates in the Sparkbox Standard I linked earlier.

Notes:* A quick summary of the work being done, usually matching your commit descriptions.
* A link to any related stories or issues, like a JIRA card.
* A link or screenshot of the original design work. As a dev, I love screenshots in addition to design files, as I can use them for quick reference.
* Step-by-step testing instructions, including how to run Linters or tests, how to navigate to the new work, and how, specifically, the new work is meant to function.

      ![Good PR Example](images/better-pr.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 85vh" -->
Notes:* Bryan has hit a number of these, here.
* Pull Requests should be written in the context of the developer reviewing the work.
* A PR to a developer who is only doing review or QA may look completely different than a PR written to someone who wrote the build process.
* Know your audience, I guess. For example, conference attendees love gifs!

* By including a gif, you can give the necessary context and allow everyone to feel confident in what they are approving.

##### [recordit.co](http://recordit.co/)
Notes:* One downside to RecordIt is that it doesn‚Äôt currently support &#x60;https&#x60;, which means, as you may know, it cannot be embedded directly into a PR on GitHub. However, it can still work in Slack or via a link.

### Gifox
###### [gifox.io](https://gifox.io/)
Notes:* As an alternative, I&#x27;ve recently discovered Gifox.
* This is a native app that creates gifs you can host via GitHub just like an image.
* Direct uploads give you the full privacy of your repo, so you&#x27;re hopefully not violating any security policies!
* It does cost $5, or included if you have Setapp, and only works on MacOS.

      # Enhance Your Pull Request: with Video
Notes:* An important aspect of a complicated PR is the ability to walk someone through your code.

### GoVideo by Vidyard
##### [vidyard.com/govideo](https://www.vidyard.com/govideo/)
Notes:* GoVideo is a Chrome Extension that lets a user record their screen, face, and voice all at once.
* I know not everyone is a fan of Chrome, Vidyard does have a native app I haven&#x27;t tested.
* Specifically, we used videos on an engagement where the main reviewer, me, was not dedicated to the project full-time.
* Because I was not available for standups, did not have a direct hand in building the site, and wasn‚Äôt familiar with the changes being reviewed, the dev needed to explain the changes clearly for every PR. Video made this easy and accessible.
* GoVideo is one of my new favorite ways to start a code review. I‚Äôve made you a video to prove just how helpful it can be.
* I keep meaning to re-record this, but people tell me awkwarness is endearing. So here goes.

### GoVideo by Vidyard
##### [vidyard.com/govideo/](https://www.vidyard.com/govideo/)
Notes:* Depending on the size of the PR, a walk-through video only adds 5-10 minutes total to our setup time, but can potentially save the 30-60 minutes it might take to explain your PR via Slack or email (or scheduling a Zoom meeting).
* Video walkthroughs are useful when pairing with developers who have different schedules, who are remote, or who are not as familiar with the engagement.

Notes:* Offer an alternative. If you have constructive feedback, try offering an alternative solution. I like to provide links to examples if I can, too.
* Phone a friend. If you find there is a disagrement that has passed back and forth a few times, call in a third person to be a tiebreaker. Be willing to admit when you are wrong if needed. This can be uncomfortable, yes, but smart people who admit their mistakes get a ton of respect from me.
* Choose which hills to die on. If dangle commas are preferable, but they aren&#x27;t in the style guide, maybe let that one slide from time to time.
* Keep the tone light. Have fun! Keep things lighthearted with bad jokes, emoji, and gifs. There are way too many dancing superhero gifs on the internet to not include them in your review approvals.

      # Give Valuable Feedback: Be Nice
Notes:* One last way to make your PRs friendlier is to, well, be friendly.
* A spat via GitHub comments is no way to collaborate, and let‚Äôs face it, we know communication via text doesn‚Äôt always communicate tone (a good reason to use emoji üòÅ ).

      ###### Bryan Braun, Sparkbox Developer, Eagle Scout <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## "Stop Giving Depressing Code Reviews"
##### [tiny.cc/foundry-braun](tiny.cc/foundry-braun)
Notes:* A coworker of mine, Bryan, wrote an article about this topic.
* The idea is to give as much positive code feedback as you do correction.

* This is really difficult for me. My Meyers-Briggs type is a INTJ. Famous INTJs are such lovable characters, like Minecroft from Sherlock, Walter White from Breaking Bad, and Littlefinger from Game of Thrones. We&#x27;re not nice by default. We can be a little, eh, direct.
* Sometimes positive feedback feels fake, but that&#x27;s okay. It won&#x27;t read that way.
* I really like leading zeros on decimal points in CSS. In any language, I enjoy descriptive comments. I am always complimenting these things when I see them. 
* It may feel forced, but it is honest.

      ## Be Nice.
Notes:* This is my last feedback for you all, but it is the single most important thing I&#x27;ve shared today.
* A few positive comments make a huge difference in overall tone of a review, whether you are speaking with developers, designers, or other team contributors.
* Hopefully at least one of these tools can make the PR experience more accessible for your whole team‚Äînot just the developers.
* With a healthy dose of empathy, we can improve the way our coworkers review the code we write, and as a result, we can create smoother workflows, increase both speed and communication, and make better websites.

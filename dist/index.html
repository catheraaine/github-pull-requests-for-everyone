Notes:The first time I gave this talk it was in a 45 minute slot. It took me about 36 minutes. I gave it again in a one hour slot at conference called CodeMash in January. I added a few slides to make up for the time, so of course, it only took 32 minutes. The last time I gave it, I needed to fit everything into a 30 minute slot. I cut out the stuff I added and told my self to talk quickly. So, of course, it only took me 17 minutes.

      # How Sparkbox Does Code Reviews
Notes:* I am going to share with you a few tools and techniques to make your pull requests more effective and collaborative.
* Because of time, I hope to do a quick summary of a few tools and I hope you will look into them further afterward.
* Most of these tools are not GitHub exclusive, so I hope at least one will be useful to each one of you.
* To start, I should explain a bit about how Sparkbox does code reviews.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ![Female code octocat by Github](images/octo-cat.png)  <!-- .element: style="height: 95vh" -->
Notes:* I&#x27;ve heard a bit about your process, and I know it is a little different from our baseline. Most of these slides are for context, so take it or leave it.
* At Sparkbox, we store nearly all of our code on GitHub, in shared repositories dedicated to whatever engagement on which we are currently working.
* When developers have new code to add to the project, they ask other developers for a code review via a pull request. Also called a &quot;merge request&quot;.
* I&#x27;ve come up with six sort of &quot;Rules&quot; that Sparkboxers adhear to while using Git Cloud Storage.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule One <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## No one merges their own code.
Notes:* Sparkbox likes to avoid the concept of a ‚Äúdeveloper island‚Äù where one developer is writing and merging all code for a piece of a website.
* Last year we had a client want an additional full-time developer for a side project. We offered two developers at half time, having a reviewer is that important.
* I&#x27;ve heard you require two sign-offs for something to be merged, so you&#x27;re already on board.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule Two <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Never push directly to master.
Notes:* Pushing directly to master is the easiest way to break everything.
* Requiring a code review reinforces the quality code we&#x27;ve come to value.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule Three <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## If you are working with UI, get a design review. üé®
Notes:* At Sparkbox, we have a ‚ÄúFrontend Designer‚Äù on every project we design. This special designer often writes frontend code.
* But not every company has designers who know how to code, nor should they (that&#x27;s a talk for another day).
* Having a designer do a visual check of your site saves time correcting things after merge.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule Four <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## If you‚Äôre working on copy, get a copy review. üìì
Notes:* At Sparkbox, this often comes from the Project Manager, or perhaps a client.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ###### Rule Five <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Never, ever push directly to master. üò¨
Notes:* Okay, unless you messed up. But if you did, find a buddy to pair with.
* which leads me to:

      ###### Rule Six <!-- .element: class="short-title" -->
## Rules are more like... guidelines. üòâ
#### github.com/sparkbox/standard <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Notes:* This ensures we follow the basic Sparkbox Creed: Working together for a Web Built Right.
* If every piece of code has at least two people contributing it, then we often catch mistakes before they happen.
* If you are interested in more about this kind of thing at Sparkbox specifically, it is documented in our Standard.
</script>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:"class="slide ">
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Challenges of Collaboration
Notes:* Collaboration is hard, and comes with all kinds of challenges, such as
* Getting a PR Review from a non-coder.
* Getting a PR Review from someone in a different time zone.
* Working with developers who may _only_ be doing reviews on your project.
* How do we improve these things?

    <script type="text/template">
      # Write Good Stories
Notes:* To ensure good pull requests, try to write good issues.
* At Sparkbox, we often use ZenHub, GitHub Projects, Jira, or Trello to organize engagements, usually with something like Scrum. But not &quot;real&quot; Scrum. Scrum-adjacent. Ask Drew if you have questions about that.
* Our workflow usually involves creating &quot;stories&quot; representing bite-sized chunks of work.

    <script type="text/template">
      ![Good Story Example](images/good-story.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->
Notes:* A story should include the requirements of the work and a potential solution (if you have one in mind).
* A story or issue doesn‚Äôt need to be overly complicated, but should be easy to understand.
* A well-written story makes for clear requirements when it comes time to PR.
* This leads you to my first tool recomendation, and the only one that BitBucket doesn&#x27;t yet have.

### Github Issue Templates
##### [tiny.cc/github-issue-templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
###### via GitHub
Notes:* Issue Templates (and PR Templates) allow you to add a markdown file to your root directory to outline the issue process.

    <script type="text/template">
      ![Issue template highlighted in the file tree](images/issue-temp-tree.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100vh" -->
Notes:* In addition to adding the template file to the root of your project, you can include it via you &#x60;.github&#x60; directory.
* PR Templates are also a thing that can go in this directory. They work the same but have a different filename.

* These example files are stored in the repo I linked at the begining, and I&#x27;ll share the link again at the end.

### Github Issue Templates
##### [tiny.cc/github-issue-templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
###### via GitHub
Notes:* While BitBucket does not directly support templates, it is still possible to have a template or a set of parameters to work from.
* Talk with your project team to decide what should go into this template, mine is just an example.

      ###### Kasey Bonifacio, Sparkbox Developer
## "Writing Better Release Notes"
##### tiny.cc/foundry-bonifacio
Notes:* A coworker of mine, Kasey, whom you know, wrote an article somewhat recently about writing release notes as your stories are closed.
* We&#x27;ve begun integrating this into a number of projects, a few of them within the templates themselves.
* There are also example PR and Issue templates in the Sparkbox Standard I linked earlier.

* A link to any related stories or issues, like a JIRA card.
* A link or screenshot of the original design work. As a dev, I love screenshots in addition to design files, as I can use them for quick reference.
* Step-by-step testing instructions, including how to run Linters or tests, how to navigate to the new work, and how, specifically, the new work is meant to function.

* A PR to a developer who is only doing review or QA may look completely different that a PR written to someone who wrote the build process.

Notes:* This is one of my favorites, because it is a Cat. Coding. It&#x27;s me.
* But what if a gif can be more than a quick laugh?
* Gifs are awesome for showing nav functionality, transitions, hover effects, animations, and pretty much any visual aspect of your work.
* Gifs are especially useful for getting a design review of an animation or hover from someone who may not have the site running locally.

### Recordit
##### [recordit.co](http://recordit.co/)
Notes:* RecordIt is a screencasting service that lets you save your finished recording as a .gif and even gives you the hosted link.

    <script type="text/template">
      ![RecordiT Gif](images/record-it.gif) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 100%" -->
Notes:* An example is the Foundry, the Sparkbox blog: the CMS that the Foundry is built on is a big deal to set up, especially for a designer or project manager trying to review one or two lines of code or content.
* By including a gif, you can give the necessary context and allow everyone to feel confident in what they are approving.

### Recordit
##### [recordit.co](http://recordit.co/)
Notes:* One downside to RecordIt is that it doesn‚Äôt currently support &#x60;https&#x60;, which means, as you may know, it cannot be embedded directly into a PR on GitHub, however, it can still work in Slack or via a link.

      ![Gifox](images/gifox.png) <!-- .element: style="max-height: 60vh" -->
### Gifox
##### [gifox.io](https://gifox.io/)
Notes:* As an alternative, I&#x27;ve recently discovered Gifox.
* This is a native app that creates gifs you can host via GitHub just like an image.
* Direct uploads give you the full privacy of your repo, so you&#x27;re hopefully not violating any security policies!
* It does cost $5, or included if you have Setapp, and only works on MacOS.

      # Enhance Your Pull Request: with Video
Notes:* An important aspect of a complicated PR is the ability to walk someone through your code.
* In the current age, devs are often distributed or remote; we work in different timezones and have busy schedules.
* Sometimes it is nearly impossible to schedule 30 minutes to step through some code.

### GoVideo by Vidyard
##### [vidyard.com/govideo/](https://www.vidyard.com/govideo/)
Notes:* GoVideo is a Chrome Extension that lets a user record their screen, face, and voice all at once.
* I know not everyone is a fan of Chrome, Vidyard does have a native app I haven&#x27;t tested.
* Specifically, we used videos on an engagement where the main reviewer, me, was not dedicated to the project full-time.
* Because I was not available for standups, did not have a direct hand in building the site, and wasn‚Äôt familiar with the changes being reviewed, the dev needed to explain the changes clearly for every PR.
* GoVideo is one of my new favorite ways to start a code review, I‚Äôve made you a video to prove just how helpful it can be.
* I keep meaning to re-record this, but people tell me awkwarness is endearing.

### GoVideo by Vidyard
##### [vidyard.com/govideo/](https://www.vidyard.com/govideo/)
Notes:* Depending on the size of the PR, a walk-through video only adds 5-10 minutes total to our setup time, but can potentially save the 30-60 minutes it might take to explain your PR via Slack or email (or scheduling a Zoom meeting).
* Video walkthroughs are useful when pairing with developers who have different schedules, who are remote, or who are not as familiar with the engagement.

##### [evernote.com/products/skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch)

##### [evernote.com/products/skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch)
Notes:* Skitch works well in the opposite direction of RecordIt. It‚Äôs an easy way for designers to communicate desired changes with developers‚Äîmake this bigger, reduce this space, delete this link, etc.

- Offer an alternative. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Phone a friend. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Choose which hills to die on. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Keep the tone light. üòÅ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Notes:* Offer an alternative. If you have constructive feedback, try offering an alternative solution. I like to provide links to examples if I can, too.
* Phone a friend. If you find there is a disagrement that has passed back and forth a few times, call in a third person to be a tiebreaker. Since you all have two reviewers, you are probably already doing this. Be willing to admit when you are wrong if needed. This can be uncomfortable, yes, but smart people who admit their mistakes get a ton of respect from me.
* Choose which hills to die on. If dangle commas are preferable, but they aren&#x27;t in the style guide, maybe let that one slide from time to time.
* Keep the tone light. Have fun! Keep things lighthearted with bad jokes, emoji, and gifs. There are way too many dancing superhero gifs on the internet to not include them in your review approvals.

      ###### Bryan Braun, Sparkbox Developer
## "Stop Giving Depressing Code Reviews"
##### tiny.cc/foundry-braun
Notes:* A coworker of mine, Bryan, whom you know, wrote an article about this topic.
* The idea is to give as much positive code feedback as you do correction.

      <blockquote>‚ÄúGiving positive feedback is an easy habit to adopt. You're already reading through the lines of code, looking for issues. It doesn't take much time to throw in a ‚ÄòNice!‚Äô or ‚ÄòLooks great!‚Äô If you see something awesome, say it!‚Äù<br /> - Bryan Braun</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">* This is really difficult for me. My Meyers-Briggs type is a INTJ. Famous INTJs are such lovable characters, like Minecroft from Sherlock, Walter White from Breaking Bad, and Littlefinger from Game of Thrones. We&#x27;re not nice by default. We can be a little direct.
* Sometimes positive feedback feels fake, but that&#x27;s okay. It won&#x27;t read that way.
* I really like leading zeros on decimal points in CSS. In any language, I enjoy descriptive comments. I am always complimenting these things, and it may feel forced, but it is honest.
* A few positive comments make a huge difference in overall tone of a review, whether you are speaking with developers, designers, or other team contributors.

* Hopefully at least one of these tools can make the PR experience more accessible for your whole team‚Äînot just the developers.
* With a healthy dose of empathy, we can improve the way our coworkers review the code we write, and as a result, we can create smoother workflows, increase both speed and communication, and make better websites.
